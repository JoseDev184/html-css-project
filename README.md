this course is really helpful because we make it a website where with can work with Sass and css advance in more detail!


Sass

sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language 
in other to work with Sass on our project with need a Sass-compiled

variable: for reusable values such as colors, font sizes, and spaces;
nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code;
operations: for mathematical operations  right inside;
partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and import them all into one single file;
mixins: to write reusable CSS code;
functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used;
extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them;

node js allows the developer to write and run  javascript applications on the server developer starter using node js
to also write tools to help them with local web development.

"NPM init" in the command line is going to create a package Json to start working with Sass

 npm install node-sass --save-dev to create a  sass compiled on the terminal
 working on the error terminal show now!

 so far I have created a package.json for de dependency on the project  I have to update the version for both NPM and Node Js.
 the command line was " NPM INIT" and NPM install other I have to run a command "NPM install node-sass --save-dev"!
 I'm  working on running the command line "npm run compile:sass" to compile the css with the sass file 

 took me like 7 hours to find the problem  I fixed changed the name of the carpet! let continue
 if I want to watch my code with the command line like "watch sass function I have to add -w to the script on packet json!

 Monday and Tuesday are the best days to programming this week i will finish my sass project and complete 8 hours of work!

 ok ok tirame el bic, shut up mind all right let contiinue with this project learning deep css ans sass 
 if we select the element .header for example in sass with dont have to use sudoclasses like .header_text-box with use &_text_box:

 .header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
      to right bottom,
      rgba(209, 10, 10, 0.154),
      rgba(144, 144, 195, 0.652)
    ),
    url(/image/rsz_viator_shutterstock_186247-1200x809.webp);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  position: relative;

  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);

  &__logo-box {
    position: absolute;
    top: 4rem;
    left: 4rem;
  }

  &__logo {
    height: 4.5rem;
  }

  &__text-box {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center;
  }
}


create a carpet for each sass code and functions to have an organized code clear that others can get what you are coding "Import" is the code that is used to link the code with the main sass file.

@import "abstracts/functions";
@import "abstracts/mixins";
@import "abstracts/variables";

@import "base/base";
@import "base/animations";
@import "base/typography";
@import "base//utilities";

@import "pages/home";
